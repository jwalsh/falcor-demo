- JSONGraph contains the list of nouns and the noun items
- domain model items are aggregated into NounById objects
- sequences of those nouns use separate references to them with a lookup
- Paths are list of keys
- Keys just provide a lookup
- PathSets are lists of KeySets that allow lookup into the underlying model (from the JSONGraph)
